### Udactiy Data Science Projects

This repo holds all of my projects from the data science w/python course on Udacity. Will also have some python exercises from there as well. Maybe machine learning as well.

These projects are built on Python 2.7 utilizing anaconda virtual environments. To load the necessary dependencies on your machine, 
load the ```enironment.yaml``` file that can be found in the main "Udacity" directory of this repo.
