# Udacity Projects

This repo holds all of my projects inspired by or completed with the Data Science, Machine Learning, or Python course from Udacity. Repo is split into folders for each course.

These projects are built on different versions of Python by utilizing Anaconda virtual environments. Check each folder's README and environment.yml file if you would like dependency information for a specific project.
